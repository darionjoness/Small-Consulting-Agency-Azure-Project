# Project Portfolio

This project portfolio showcases my skills, experiences, and projects related to Azure technologies, specifically framed around the Azure Administrator certification (AZ-104). It includes detailed documentation, screenshots, and results from my capstone project.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves to demonstrate my proficiency in Azure management, governance, and best practices within the context of real-world applications. As I work through the modules, I will be providing insights and learning outcomes that pertain to each section of the curriculum. 

### Folder Structure

The following folder structure will be used to organize all related files, modules, and documentation:

- az104-azure-administrator/
  - modules/
    - 08-capstone/
      - README.md (Instructions for the capstone project, required sections, and submission guidelines)
